Hamlet talks to the 
actors before they perform. He wants the play to 'hold a mirror up to 
nature' as the plot is very similar to the events leading up to his 
father’s death. Hamlet instructs Horatio to observe Claudius’ response 
to the play to see if he shows any guilt. The performance begins by 
depicting a happily married king and queen but the player king becomes 
sick and worries that his queen may marry again. Another actor enters 
and poisons the player king. Hamlet announces that this man plots to 
marry the dead king’s wife and, at this moment, Claudius rises in fury 
and calls for 'light' before storming out of the performance. Queen 
Gertrude follows him. Hamlet and Horatio take this reaction as proof 
that the ghost was telling the truth and Claudius killed his brother. 
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern summon Hamlet to talk to his mother and he 
snaps at them, declaring that he has known all along that they were 
spying on him. Alone, Hamlet talks about revenge and says ‘now could I 
drink hot blood / And do such bitter business as the day / Would quake 
to look on'.
