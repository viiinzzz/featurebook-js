Rosencrantz and 
Guildenstern report to Claudius, telling him that they don’t know why 
Hamlet is behaving strangely. Claudius then arranges a meeting between 
Hamlet and Ophelia so that he and Polonius can hide and watch them. They
 believe this will confirm whether Hamlet is sick with love or not. 
Before this, Hamlet delivers a soliloquy talking about his own existence
 and delivering his famous speech beginning ‘To be, or not to be, that 
is the question’. When Ophelia enters, Hamlet confuses her with mixed 
messages. One moment he says 'I did love you once', the next 'I loved 
you not'. He goes on to insult Ophelia and tells her to go to a nunnery 
to repent her sins. Ophelia doesn't understand the way he treats her and
 can't believe she 'sucked the honey of his music vows' in the past. 
Having seen all of this, Claudius decides that Hamlet is not in love 
with Ophelia and believes 'what he spake, though it lacked for a little,
 was not like madness'.
