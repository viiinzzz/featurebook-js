  - Notice how Hamlet behaves towards Ophelia 
    in Scenes 1 and 2. Why is Hamlet so cruel to her in this Act? Has he 
    really stopped loving her? Why else might he treat her so badly?
  
  - Look closely at the choices Hamlet makes in
     this act, particularly when he decides not to kill Claudius and then, 
    in the next scene, murders Polonius by accident. Why do you think Hamlet
     stops himself from killing Claudius whilst he’s alone and asking God 
    for forgiveness? Do you think Hamlet believes in God? Are there any 
    signs, before Polonius’ death, that Hamlet is capable of murder?
  
  - Take note of Hamlet’s behaviour in Act 3 
    Scene 4. Are you surprised by Hamlet’s behaviour in this scene? Why do 
    you think he behaves this way? What do you notice about his reaction to 
    Polonius’ death and does it surprise you? Has your view of Hamlet 
    changed following this scene?
  
  - Act 3 is important because it confirms 
    Claudius’ guilt – from his reaction to the play, Hamlet learns that his 
    uncle was responsible for killing his father. How does Hamlet react to 
    this?
