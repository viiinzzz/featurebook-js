Two gravediggers are 
discussing whether Ophelia should have a Christian burial when she is 
believed to have killed herself. As the two characters dig the grave, 
they throw out the bones of other dead people and sing songs. Hamlet 
passes this grave with Horatio and is shocked to see the bones of dead 
people being treated so badly. One of the gravediggers shows Hamlet the 
skull of a court jester. Hamlet is taken aback saying ‘Alas poor Yorick!
 I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent 
fancy'. Hamlet then contemplates how we all turn to dust in the end. The
 scene is interrupted by the royal family and Laertes entering the 
graveyard to bury Ophelia. An argument takes place between Laertes and 
Hamlet when Hamlet leaps into the grave and says 'I loved Ophelia: forty
 thousand brothers / Could not -- with all their quantity of love -- / 
Make up my sum’ and they fight. Hamlet leaves and Horatio goes after 
him.
