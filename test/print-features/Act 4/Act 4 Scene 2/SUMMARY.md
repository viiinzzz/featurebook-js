Claudius worries that he
 cannot punish Hamlet too much because the people of Denmark love him. 
When Claudius questions Hamlet over the whereabouts of Polonius’ body, 
he answers in riddles again before saying that he will smell the corpse 
‘as you go up the stairs into the lobby’. Claudius informs Hamlet that 
he must travel to England for his own ‘especial safety’. Alone, Claudius
 reveals that he has sent letters to England ordering the ‘present 
death’ of Hamlet and is pleased that he will be out of the way.
