Claudius tells Laertes 
that Hamlet left Denmark without being punished for Polonius’ murder 
because the Danish people love him. News reaches Claudius that Hamlet is
 now back in Denmark and he plots with Laertes to set up a duel between 
Hamlet and Laertes. Laertes says ‘I’ll anoint my sword’ and plans to dip
 his blade in deadly poison before the fight. Claudius doesn't want to 
take any risks so he says he will also prepare a 'chalice' of poison for
 Hamlet to drink in case he ‘by chance escape your venom’d stuck’. 
Gertrude then enters with the news that Ophelia has drowned herself. 
Laertes is too devastated to cry and says 'Too much of water hast thou, 
poor Ophelia, / And therefore I forbid my tears'.
