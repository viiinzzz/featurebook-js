- Notice how each of the characters reacts to
   Polonius’ murder. How do Gertrude and Claudius each feel and how do 
  they act in the scenes that follow? Why do you think Hamlet takes the 
  body of Polonius away with him after Act 3 and hides it? Do you think 
  others characters would have reacted differently if he had left the 
  body?

- Look closely at the structure of this act. 
  Act 4 has six scenes; what effect does this have on the drama? How might
   this affect the pace of the story and why would Shakespeare want to 
  create that pace?

- Take note of Ophelia’s behaviour when she 
  talks to Gertrude and Claudius. What do her songs reveal? Do you think 
  this is grief or madness? Would Ophelia have killed herself if Polonius 
  had been killed by someone other than Hamlet? How responsible is Hamlet 
  for Ophelia’s death?

- Act 4 is important because we see the 
  responses to Hamlet’s actions in Act 3 – Gertrude and Claudius react 
  very differently, Ophelia commits suicide and Laertes returns and plans 
  his revenge with the king. What does their plan tell you about Claudius 
  and Laertes? Who is the driving force behind their plot and why would 
  they chose this method of murder?
