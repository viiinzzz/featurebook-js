Polonius employs a 
servant to travel to Paris and spy on his son, Laertes. Polonius then 
learns that Hamlet has been behaving oddly towards Ophelia and has been 
physically rough with her. Polonius claims 'This is the very ecstasy of 
love, / Whose violent property fordoes itself / And leads the will to 
desperate undertakings'. He believes Hamlet is sick with love for his 
daughter and intends to report this to the king.
