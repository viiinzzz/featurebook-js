- Look at how the gravediggers speak to each 
  other and to Hamlet in Scene 1. These characters are often called 
  ‘clowns' and the way they speak is very light-hearted, with jokes and 
  songs. Why do you think Shakespeare included humour in the final act of 
  this tragedy? Particularly in a scene where Hamlet talks about death and
   then sees Ophelia’s funeral?

- Take note of the number of deaths in the 
  final scene. How many deaths do you think Claudius is responsible for, 
  directly or indirectly?

- Notice the way Hamlet behaves in the final 
  scenes, accepting Laertes’ challenge, avenging his mother’s death and 
  reconciling with Laertes. Why do you think some people consider Hamlet a
   ‘hero’? Would you agree that he is a heroic figure?

- In Act 5 we see the tragic conclusion of 
  the play – Hamlet accepts Laertes’ challenge and is poisoned during the 
  fight. Laertes, Claudius and Gertrude also all die. The only central 
  character left alive at the end of the play is Horatio and Hamlet asks 
  him, as he dies, to ‘tell my story’. Why do you think Shakespeare leaves
   Horatio alive? Why do you think the final lines of the play are 
  delivered by Fortinbras? Are there any parallels you can draw between 
  Fortinbras and Hamlet?
