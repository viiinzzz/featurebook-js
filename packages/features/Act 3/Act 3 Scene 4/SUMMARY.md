Hamlet visits his mother
 in her closet and threatens her. Polonius is spying on them from behind
 an arras[?](https://www.rsc.org.uk/shakespeare-learning-zone/hamlet/story/scene-by-scene#_anno0) and when Gertrude screams, Polonius makes a noise. Hamlet is shocked 
and stabs through the arras with a knife. He is surprised when he pulls 
back the screen to see the dead body of Polonius. Hamlet’s fury builds 
as he confesses his disgust at his mother’s recent marriage. The ghost 
of his father appears and tells him not to be so harsh on Gertrude. 
Gertrude either can’t see the spirit or pretends not to. Hamlet demands 
that his mother changes her ways and that she doesn’t tell Claudius 
about their meeting. He also reveals that he knows about the plan for 
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to take him to England and tells her he has
 to go. Hamlet leaves the closet, pulling the corpse of Polonius with 
him. Gertrude then tells Claudius that Hamlet is ‘Mad as the seas and 
wind when both contend / Which is the mightier’ and has killed the ‘good
 old man’ Polonius. She tells him Hamlet has gone ‘to draw apart the 
body he hath killed’, and taken the body away.
