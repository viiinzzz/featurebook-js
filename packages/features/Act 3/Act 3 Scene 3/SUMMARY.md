Claudius has grown tired
 of Hamlet’s antics and tells Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to get ready 
to go to England. He wants to send them away from Denmark, with Hamlet. 
Alone, Claudius sinks to his knees and prays. He confesses to the murder
 of his brother, whispering 'O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven:
 / It hath the primal eldest curse upon’t, / A brother’s murder'. Hamlet
 observes him as he prays but decides not to kill his uncle while he is 
talking to God.
