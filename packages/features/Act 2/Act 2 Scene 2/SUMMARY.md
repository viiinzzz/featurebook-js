Claudius invites Hamlet’s childhood friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to Elsinore Castle to investigate 'Hamlet’s transformation’ and find 
out why he is behaving strangely. Polonius enters and shares his view 
with Claudius and Gertrude that Hamlet has been driven to madness 
because of his love for Ophelia. Polonius reads from a letter that 
Hamlet sent his daughter: 'Doubt that the stars are fire, / Doubt that 
the sun doth move, / Doubt truth to be a liar, / But never doubt I 
love'. Polonius suggests the king and queen spy on Hamlet as he talks to
 him. Hamlet speaks in riddles, suggesting that he is mad, though his 
speech also contains hidden meanings which Polonius picks up on. 
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern enter and Hamlet reveals that he knows they
 were sent to spy on him. They announce that the ‘tragedians of the 
city’ are arriving to cheer Hamlet up. The travelling players arrive and
 Hamlet asks them to perform a moving speech from ‘Hecuba and Priam’. He
 then asks them to perform 'The Murder of Gonzago' for the king and his 
guests the following evening. Before they leave he gets their permission
 for him to write a 12 line speech that he wants to be included in the 
play. Alone, he praises the actor who delivered the speech for 
connecting to his true emotions when performing and criticises himself 
for being unable to express his inner feelings.
