Ophelia visits the 
queen, who does not want to see her but eventually she agrees. Ophelia 
sings songs and when Claudius comes in he and Gertrude agree that 
Ophelia is sick and he says that ‘this is the poison of deep grief: it 
springs / All from her father’s death’. Messengers then report that 
Laertes has returned and that the Danish people want him to be their 
king. When Laertes enters he is in a rage, demanding to know what 
happened to his father. He then sees the state of his sister Ophelia, 
exclaiming ‘O heavens, is’t possible a young maid’s wits / Should be as 
mortal as an old man’s life?’ Hearing news that Hamlet is responsible 
for both tragedies, he declares that Hamlet will have an ‘obscure burial
 -- / No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o’er his bones’.
