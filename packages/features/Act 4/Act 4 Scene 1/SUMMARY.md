When Rosencrantz and 
Guildenstern find Hamlet, he tells them he keeps his ‘own counsel’ and 
will not listen to them. He tells them that Claudius is using them like a
 ‘sponge’ and ‘when he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing 
you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again’. He refuses to tell them where
 the body is, answering their questions in riddles.
